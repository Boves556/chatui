# Multichat system between doctor and client
## Slight description
This project is a multiuser chat application designed to facilitate secure and efficient communication between healthcare providers and their patients. It can also be used by regular individuals and ensures data privacy and security through end-to-end encryption.

## How to run the code
To run the server.py:
```
python server.py 3490
```
To run the client.py:
```
python client.py <clientname> localhost 3490
```
example:
```
python chat_client.py chris localhost 3490
```
Its important to **note** that you should open muiltiple clients with different client names to be able to text between each other.

Please let me know if you encounter any issues or bugs or if you have better ideas on how I can improve the code.
